Recommendation system
(Movie streaming app)


Problem Definition
	Consider each arm represents a movie. User interaction with stream is considered as a reward. ( Eg. Clicking on the arm that represents a movie) . 

Approach
	1. Collect data such as user ratings, watch time and genres preferred. 

	2. Use Epsilon-Greedy algorithm .Two methods are followed here. Take epsilon as a 
	random number. With probability of epsilon , randomly select an arm that represents a      
            movie and recommend it to the user for exploring new options. With probability of 1- 
            epsilon, select an arm using the current knowledge , that is an arm with highest estimated   
            reward and  recommend it to the user . This is called exploitation. 

	3. Consider every click and positive review for the recommended arm as a positive reward. 
	Consider ever negative review or low rating for the recommended arm as a negative reward.

	4. This algorithm is efficient as it exploits current knowledge and explores random new 
            options.

	5. Using epsilon parameter ,  you can control the balance of exploration - exploitation.
